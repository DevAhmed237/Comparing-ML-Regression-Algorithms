# Comparing-ML-Regression-Algorithms
This project aims to compare the performance of multiple machine learning regression algorithms on the "mpg" dataset. The project focuses on predicting the fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) of various automobile models based on their attributes. By implementing and evaluating different regression algorithms, the project seeks to identify the most accurate model for fuel efficiency prediction.
